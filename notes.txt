✅ *The problem of styling with jsx and widthStyles has been solved using SCSS as external styling files for all components
so all styles now are even withStyles for material ui components or scss files*
> - Delete the usersRouter.js
✅ Done
> - Apply.js has some weird state. gilad, jason and antoine, what is this?
> - Apply.js line 46 oneline
> - Apply.js line 180 oneline
✅ They were coming from the example at material ui website. I deleted them and changed `gilad: true` to `haveComputer: true,`
> - The phone number should have type telephone i think its called
✅ Done (it is type='tel')
> - All files in the components should be called what the folder is called, so contact-form should be called contact-form.js
✅ Done
> - contact form line 26 redundant when we only have one
⚠ I did'nt find redundant line
line 26 contains: `const { classes } = this.props`
> - Remove all the &nbsp; and just style the svg to have left margin instead
✅ Done
> - Content apply.js line 2 fill bad name, where is it used?
⚠ this is line 2 `import marked from 'marked'` what do you mean?
> - Delete coding test
✅ Done
> - In all the content you export different ways, standardize that. I prefer returning the object way
✅ Done
> - newsletter content is a let, should be const (or is there a reason?)
✅ Done (no reason)
> - Delete sample.js
✅ Done
> - footer/sponsors/index.js the styling is weirdly indented
✅ moved to `footer/sponsors/sponsors.scss` & indent reformat
> - Sponsor line 50 is misspelled
✅ Done (fixed in all places)
> - The sponsors/new is not so good. Maybe the sponsors folder should be updated
✅ Done
> - The src in the src could be nice as string literal
✅ replaced with template string
> - The names of the images should be changed.
⚠ which images
> - The links should be updated with the relevant links
⚠ ??
> - Should the find us be part of the footer? I dont think it should.
✅ moved to components folder
> - ALL id's and classnames should be seperated with dash so contentExtra -> content-extra. They should ALL start with lowercase so Copyright -> copyright
> - Footer line 5 should not have a class called footer, we can get that from the just the footer
> - In the styling indent the styling, so the scope is more narrow: .footer {margin-top: 30px; .links {etc.}}
> - Remove all unused styling
> - You style in different ways, why is that?
> - I dont think the sponsors should be part of the footer.
> - Your footer classnames should be changed. Fx links contain a lot more than links and bottom is actually at the top.
> - Hire alumni.json we should stick with a naming of keys. You change it around. fx graduation_date onlineCV i think we should use camelCase so: onlineCV
> - Hire index.js: line 21 why are you desctructuring the skills array when it is empty?
> - The same with the status list
> - Line 26 should maybe be called unique skills and unique statusList?
> - Line 33 you have to explain me. Its a little heavy.
> - In general the filterHandler is tricky!
> - Line 93 why index + 1?
> - Line 96 i would name selected. If it is selected it has the background color. The problem with the outlined and contained is that what if we want it to not be outlined when not selected. Then we need to change the name aswell. This we want to avoid
> - Expansion panel line 22 and 23 is maybe a bit overkill
> - The layout content.js where are we using that?
> - layout.js line 65 there is some BEM there.
> - We should update the favicon
> - The navbar should show the elements on hover.
> - What is the difference between the navMenu and the nav-bar?
> - Consistent file naming. expansionPanel -> expansion-panel
> - All outcommented code should be removed
> - For the team.json there should be a key that defines is the members are core or not. Relying on people remembering the first 3 is core is difficult. And what if there comes more core people.
> - Item-card.js i think you can destructure in directly in the first destructure. But maybe that will be a little hard to read?
> - Line 184 you have the role in the classname, why?
> - zoomIn1 -> zoom-in-1
> - Line 210 you have to explain me
> - mewsletter, where is that used?
> - When opening a link in the navbar it hides the scroll or something weird. It results in the page going slightly to the left. Could be nice to fix.
> - What is the progressbar for?
> - Pages dashboard?
- Login?
> - Newsletter?
> - Privacy?
> - We should figure out what to do with these pages, cause they are reachable just not with links
